The Pargold Mining Corporation was a government with the structure of a corporation that controlled much of the surface of [[The Station]].

## Origins

It was started by a young ambitious entrepreneur and philanthropist named [[Michael Pargold]] with the purpose strip-mining of the uninhabitable planet [[Pargold]] (which was named after him. However, the corporation soon ballooned into a having a much larger role when they expanded into construction, and then started providing protection for the citizens who resided in their areas of [[The Station]]. 

## Becoming a Government

After the fall of [[The Malthin Criminal Network]], this protection expanded into a form of government when the corporation started making laws and offered shares of the company to all property holders in their territories. At this point, the founder [[Michael Pargold]] decided that the company would need a new structure to keep up with this growing demand for a government to fill the power void. Along with the existing board of the company and representatives from the citizens, he drafted a new charter for the corporation that made its goal the wellbeing of the actively working families living on [[The Station]].
