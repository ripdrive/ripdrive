This is an open-source fiction project (the first of its kind that we know of). Anyone can submit their ideas, changes and edits.

Rip Drive is a Sci-fi universe centered around two kids whose parents go into hiding to keep their reinvention of the [[rip drive]] from falling into the hands of a powerful space pirate group.

In the prequel era, a group of about a thousand researchers and explorers go on an experimental "rip drive" ship and get stuck lightyears away from earth due to a mutiny on the ship that destroys the drive.
